    I suddenly remember days back in the city…

    the summer heat was hotter there but we had a pretty good A/C to combat it.

    Not to mention the stupid number of vending machines that has beverages 24/7.

    That city life came to a stop when my parents decided to get a divorce however, good thing they split in better conditions compared to most divorces where the couple are out to get each other.

    Our move back here in the province was a little sudden, luckily it wasn’t in the middle of a school year.

    I just remember spending a lot of time playing around and pranking a lot. If my memory serves me well, I think we moved around back when I was still in elementary school.

    I remember crying like crazy on my last day here before moving…haha.
